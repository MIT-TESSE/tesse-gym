## Installation

### From Source
Using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) is highly recommended. Python 3.7 is required.

1. If using conda, create a new environment
```sh
conda create -n tesse_gym python=3.7
conda activate tesse_gym
```

2. Clone and install this repository. 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/MIT-TESSE/tesse-gym.git
cd tesse-gym

python setup.py install

cd ..

## GOSEEK Challenge

The objective of this task is to navigate an agent through an office environment to collect randomly-spawned fruit as quickly as possible. 

[![GOSEEK Teaser Trailer](https://img.youtube.com/vi/KXTag0xsg28/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXTag0xsg28)

More specifically, the agent can select from one of four actions at each decision epoch: move forward 0.5 meters, turn left 8 degrees, turn right 8 degrees, and collect fruit within 2.0 meters of the agent's current position. Our robot is equiped with stereo cameras and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), from which a state-of-the-art perception pipeline estimates three pieces of information that make up the agent's observation at each decision epoch: localization information (position and heading relative to start position), pixel-wise semantic labels for objects in the robot's field of view, and pixel-wise depth in the robot's field of view.

### Quick Start

See the [example notebook](baselines/goseek-ppo.ipynb) to train an agent.

### Challenge Details 

See the [GOSEEK Challenge](../../../goseek-challenge) landing page for details on setup, evaluation, and submission.
