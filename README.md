- [Stable Baselines](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
- [TESSE_interface](https://github.mit.edu/TESS/TESSE_interface)

Then, clone the repo and setup the `TESSE_gym_interface` package.

```sh
git clone git@github.mit.edu:TESS/TESSE_gym_interface.git
cd TESSE_gym_interface
python setup.py develop
```

### Usage 

This package provides environments for the following tasks
- Navigation: The agent must move throughout it's environment without collisions.

- Treasure Hunt: The agent must find 'treasures' placed throughout it's environment. 
    
    See the [example notebook](https://github.mit.edu/TESS/TESSE_gym_interface/blob/master/agent-training.ipynb) to get this up and running.
   
__TODO (?)__: add some gifs and an example notebook for the navigation task.
